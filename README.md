# Electricity_Consumption

This is a personal project about Electricity Consumption where a predictive model is built by using linear regression. The dataset includes various power-related metrics, such as active and reactive power, voltage, and intensity.

## Features
- Load and preprocess electricity consumption data
- Handle missing values and convert date format
- Generate statistical insights and visualizations
- Train a linear regression model to predict electricity consumption
- Evaluate the model using performance metrics
- Visualize actual vs predicted consumption

## Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- RÂ² Score

A scatter plot of actual vs. predicted consumption is also generated.

## Chandravadan
Developed as part of an electricity consumption analysis and predictive modeling project.
